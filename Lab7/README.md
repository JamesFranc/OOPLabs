<h2>Lab7: Hashing (Separate Chaining)</h2>
<h3>PROGRAM PURPOSE:</h3>
<p> This program is used to implement to Hashtable class, and Node class, for use in a dictionary-like Structure.</p>
<p>This program will read in data from prog7.dat and search for words that may be in the hashtable based upon input from the file.</p>
